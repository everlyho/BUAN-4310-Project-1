The chart above shows the states with shortest waiting time 
to be approved. Massachusetts, Maine, Indiana and DC had the shortest waiting time. 
It took only 2.8 years for those states to be approved for their patents 
application. India was also among the top that had the shortest waiting interval,
which is 3 years. 
The interesting thing is that although California, NYC, ad Texas had the most approved
patents, the waiting interval of these states was not among the shortest ones.

The number of patents granted in the U.S stably increased through years.
In the interval of 2017-2018, number of patents slightly decreased. However, after 2018,
the number of patents increased significantly.
In India, we can see that not many patents are granted every year. The total number of patents
approved to 2019 was only 14 patents.
